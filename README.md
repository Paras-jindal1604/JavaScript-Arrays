### 📖 Introduction

Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, resizable, and can hold elements of different types.
Unlike low-level languages like C/C++, JavaScript arrays are objects with special behaviors and methods.


### 🛠️ Creating Arrays

#### ✅ Using Square Brackets (Most Common)

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

console.log(fruits);           // ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']


#### ✅ Using the Array Constructor

let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3);

console.log(numbers);         // [1, 2, 3]


#### ⚠️ Caution: Single Argument with new Array()

let emptyArray = new Array(5); 

console.log(emptyArray);       // [ <5 empty items> ]


### 🧠 Why Elements Aren’t Stored Contiguously

JavaScript arrays are not true arrays like in C or Java — they are more like hash maps with numeric keys. This means:
Elements can be sparse (i.e., missing or undefined).
Internally, the engine may optimize small, dense arrays but doesn't guarantee contiguous memory.
Arrays can store elements of different data types.


### 🔧 Common Array Methods

| Method      | Description                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `push()`    | Add to end                   |
| `pop()`     | Remove from end              |
| `shift()`   | Remove from start            |
| `unshift()` | Add to start                 |
| `slice()`   | Returns a shallow copy       |
| `splice()`  | Add/remove elements          |
| `forEach()` | Loop through elements        |



### ✅ Conclusion

JavaScript arrays are versatile and powerful — capable of handling complex structures like 2D and 3D arrays. 
Despite not being truly contiguous like in some other languages, they provide all the tools you need for flexible, dynamic data manipulation.
